# Zephyr Color Log

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg?style=flat)

This extension highlights lines starting with `<wrn>` and `<err>`, e.g.  
![sample][sample]  

Default formats are `.log` and `.txt`

Since it's initially developed for highlighting logs from [ZephyrOS](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr),
it's called the way it's called.
